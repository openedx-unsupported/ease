# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# TODO: Many pinned dependencies should be unpinned and/or moved to this constraints file.

# mock version 4.0.0 drops support for python 3.5
mock<4.0.0

# Numpy needs to be installed separately from Scipy,
# so we can't include them in the same requirements file.
numpy==1.16.5
