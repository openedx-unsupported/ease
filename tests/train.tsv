58	1	2	2	"We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes."
59	1	3	3	"Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this."
60	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged."
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
63	1	1	1	"You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass."

65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
66	1	0	0	"To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass."
67	1	1	1	"After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it."
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
71	1	1	1	"What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off."
72	1	2	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
74	1	1	1	"On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass."
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
76	1	3	3	"In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings."
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
78	1	0	0	"Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams."
79	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same."
80	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off."
81	1	3	3	"The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in."
82	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better."
83	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers."
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
85	1	1	1	"Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things."
86	1	3	3	"To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not."
87	1	0	0	"Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data."
88	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp."
89	1	0	0	"The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample."
90	1	2	2	"Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that."
91	1	3	3	"I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information."
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
93	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in."
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
95	1	3	1	"The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
96	1	0	0	"In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose."
97	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams."
98	1	1	1	"They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ."
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
102	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used."
103	1	1	1	"First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing."
104	1	2	2	"If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used."
105	1	0	2	"After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp."
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
107	1	2	3	"You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in."
108	1	3	3	"In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size."
109	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
111	1	0	0	"For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average."
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.

117	1	2	3	"You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar."
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
119	1	0	0	"Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles."
120	1	2	3	"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment."
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
122	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar."
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
124	1	1	1	"You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6."
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
129	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours."
130	1	3	3	"We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials"
131	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples."
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
133	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container."
134	1	0	0	"You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results."
135	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples."
136	1	2	3	"The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result."
137	1	2	1	"Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test."
138	1	3	3	"After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight."
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
141	1	2	2	"Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use."
142	1	2	2	"In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is."
143	1	3	2	"In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started."
144	1	3	3	"To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples."
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
150	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials."
151	1	1	1	"They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data."
152	1	2	1	"Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?."
153	1	3	3	"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale."
154	1	0	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
156	1	0	0	"Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water."
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
158	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample."
159	1	0	0	"We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass."
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
161	1	1	1	"To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass."
162	1	1	1	"There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with."
163	1	1	1	"You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results."
164	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate."
165	1	2	2	"In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers."
166	1	1	1	"Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would."
167	1	0	0	"In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient."
168	1	3	3	"To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not."
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments."
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
174	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too."
175	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment."
176	1	2	2	"To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples."
177	1	2	2	"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
179	1	2	3	"The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf."
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
181	1	0	1	"First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results."
182	1	3	3	"First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc."
183	1	2	2	"-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample."
184	1	1	1	"The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results."
185	1	0	0	"We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample."
186	1	2	2	"The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information."
187	1	1	1	"1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood."
188	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample."
189	1	0	0	"In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named."
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
191	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples"
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
194	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers."
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
196	1	3	3	"The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react."
197	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses."
198	1	1	1	"Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure."
199	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used."
200	1	0	0	"Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass."
201	1	0	0	"You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic."
202	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample."
203	1	0	0	"I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question"
204	1	3	3	"First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass."
205	1	2	2	"In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours."
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
207	1	2	2	"I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are."
208	1	0	0	"In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again."
209	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify"
210	1	1	1	"They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers."
211	1	3	3	"The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size."
212	1	0	0	Tools.
213	1	2	2	"A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use."
214	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container."
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
216	1	2	2	"One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used."
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
218	1	1	1	"Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass."
219	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing."
220	1	0	1	"The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure."
221	1	2	2	"The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure."
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.

I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results."
232	1	2	2	"Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water."
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease

If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same."
239	1	3	3	"The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how."
240	1	2	2	"You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use)."
241	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well."
242	1	2	2	"I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment."
243	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment."
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
245	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples."
246	1	0	0	"The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step."
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
248	1	1	1	"First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable."
249	1	2	2	"There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight."
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
252	1	3	3	"They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours."
253	1	1	1	"what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either."
254	1	3	3	"1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise."
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
257	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?"
258	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement."
259	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time."
260	1	2	2	"The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container."
261	1	0	0	"You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table."
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
263	1	0	0	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water."
264	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same."
265	1	3	3	"There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment."
266	1	1	1	"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
267	1	1	1	"After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment."
268	1	1	0	"The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g)."
269	1	0	0	"I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong."
270	1	3	3	"The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot."
271	1	2	0	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
272	1	1	3	"In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic."
273	1	1	2	"To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment."
274	1	1	1	"If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project."
275	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar."
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
277	1	2	2	"Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well."
278	1	1	1	"Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data."
279	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more."
280	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added."
281	1	3	3	"To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass."
282	1	1	1	"This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results."
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
284	1	1	0	First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
286	1	2	2	"They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers."
287	1	2	1	"In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test."
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
289	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size."
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
291	1	3	3	"First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes."
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
293	1	1	1	"To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will"
294	1	1	1	"Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same."
295	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results."
296	1	0	0	"You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything."
297	1	1	1	"The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic."
298	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample."
299	1	1	1	"The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct."
300	1	1	1	"The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time."
301	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used."
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
303	1	3	2	"In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate)."
304	1	1	1	"To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate."
305	1	2	2	"The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample."
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
307	1	2	2	"Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water."
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
312	1	1	2	"You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3."
313	1	3	3	"Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment."
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	"After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis."
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
319	1	2	2	"The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used."
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
322	1	3	3	"The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container."
323	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ."
324	1	2	2	"If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples."
325	1	3	3	"To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used."
326	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included."
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
328	1	2	2	"To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups."
329	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment."
330	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment."
331	1	0	0	"I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items."
332	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in."
333	1	0	0	"More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed."
334	1	0	0	"3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment."
335	1	1	1	"I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples."
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
337	1	3	3	"You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant."
338	1	0	0	"The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment."
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
341	1	3	3	"In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature."
342	1	3	3	"How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included."
343	1	3	2	"The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample."
344	1	3	3	"Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature."
345	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment."
346	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment."
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
349	1	2	2	"Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples."
350	1	1	0	"Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end."
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
353	1	0	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
354	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated."
355	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need."
356	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment."
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
359	1	3	3	"I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside."
360	1	1	1	"After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples."
361	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers."
362	1	3	3	"After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used."
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
364	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know"
365	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate."
366	1	2	2	"Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams."
367	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours."
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
369	1	2	2	"I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in."
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
372	1	0	0	"You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment."
373	1	1	1	"In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure."
374	1	0	0	"In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer."
375	1	1	1	"In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials."
376	1	0	0	"After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn."
377	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results."
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
379	1	1	1	"I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses."
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
382	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained."
383	1	2	3	"I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment."
384	1	2	2	"I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass."
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
388	1	0	0	"You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials."
389	1	2	3	"In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours."
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	"We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well."
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
394	1	1	1	"Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel."
395	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included."
396	1	0	0	"To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water."
397	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers."
398	1	2	1	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes."
399	1	2	2	"Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours."
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
401	1	1	2	"After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?"
402	1	2	2	"additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on."
403	1	0	0	"For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment."
404	1	0	0	"You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass."
405	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size."
406	1	2	3	"The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included."
407	1	0	0	"A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate."
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
409	1	2	2	"You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be"
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
411	1	0	0	"The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label."
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse."
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
417	1	3	3	"In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container."
418	1	1	1	"The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn"
419	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample."
420	1	2	2	"In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for."
421	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data."
422	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement."
423	1	3	3	"In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in."
424	1	3	3	"You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials."
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
426	1	0	0	"It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after."
427	1	1	1	"If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement."
428	1	3	3	"Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment."
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
432	1	0	0	"After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment."
433	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa."
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
437	1	1	1	"After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable."
438	1	2	1	"First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample"
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
440	1	2	2	"This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1."
441	1	2	2	"First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids."
442	1	2	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate."
443	1	2	2	"There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control."
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
445	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment."
446	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)"
447	1	1	1	"Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources."
448	1	1	1	"If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass."
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
450	1	1	1	"After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one."
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
452	1	1	1	"You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D."
453	1	0	0	"In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass."
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
458	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things."
459	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container."
460	1	0	0	"The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass."
461	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change."
462	1	3	2	"Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be."
463	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment."
464	1	3	3	"After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment."
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
466	1	3	3	"You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at."
467	1	3	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
468	1	1	1	"To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples."
469	1	3	3	"Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are."
470	1	0	0	"Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble."
471	1	1	1	"After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment."
472	1	2	2	"Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials."
473	1	3	3	"You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could"
474	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment."
475	1	1	1	"Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample."
476	1	2	2	"To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need."
477	1	1	1	"In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours."
478	1	1	1	"One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance."
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
481	1	1	1	"What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job."
482	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result."
483	1	2	2	"One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record."
484	1	0	0	"Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label.

488	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour."
489	1	1	2	"How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )"
490	1	1	1	"You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results."
491	1	2	2	"You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment."
492	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with."
493	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass."
494	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability."
495	1	2	1	"Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass."
496	1	2	2	"The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results."
497	1	0	0	"The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size."
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
500	1	3	3	"Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?."
501	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material."
502	1	1	1	"To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with."
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
505	1	3	3	"You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is."
506	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers."
507	1	2	2	"There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid."
508	1	2	2	"Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample."
509	1	2	1	"The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment."
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
511	1	2	2	"I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use."
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
513	1	2	1	"To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen."
514	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on."
515	1	3	3	"In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off."
516	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given."
517	1	1	1	"Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out."
518	1	1	1	"Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with."
519	1	3	3	"More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass."
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
521	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles."
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
523	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be."
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
525	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic."
526	1	2	3	"To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar."
527	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each"
528	1	2	2	"One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used."
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
530	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay."
531	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating."
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
533	1	0	0	"I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour."
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
537	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc."
538	1	0	0	"After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective."
539	1	2	2	"After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be"
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
541	1	2	1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
542	1	3	3	"Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water."
543	1	1	1	"A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end."
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
545	1	0	0	"Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes."
546	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container."
547	1	2	2	"First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal."
548	1	2	2	"Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible."
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	"I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?"
551	1	2	2	"To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better."
552	1	3	3	"Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers."
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
554	1	0	1	"I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly."
555	1	3	2	"I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass."
556	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material)."
557	1	0	1	"The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment."
558	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container."
559	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container."
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
562	1	1	1	"There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add"
563	1	2	2	"I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for."
564	1	1	1	"While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it."
565	1	3	3	"If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples."
566	1	2	2	"We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container."
567	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this."
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	"One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things."
572	1	0	0	"First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too."
573	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations."
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
576	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other."
577	1	3	2	"Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly."
578	1	3	3	"You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)"
579	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?"
580	1	0	0	"This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples."
581	1	1	1	"First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do."
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
584	1	1	1	"You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data."
585	1	2	2	"The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object."

589	1	2	2	"The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals."
590	1	1	0	"To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data."
591	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container."
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
593	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours."
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
595	1	1	1	"You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water."
596	1	2	2	"In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately."
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.

599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.

604	1	2	2	"You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not."
605	1	2	2	"The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?"
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.

708	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room."
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
710	1	3	3	"You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water."
711	1	0	0	"The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic."
712	1	3	3	"At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well."
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
715	1	2	2	"Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?"
716	1	1	1	"If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment."
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
718	1	2	1	"To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units."
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
720	1	1	1	"I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc."
721	1	1	1	"Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid."
722	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass."
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
725	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out."
726	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct."
727	1	1	1	"The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid"
728	1	3	3	"After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent."
729	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results."
730	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed."
731	1	2	2	"The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye."
732	1	2	2	"Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in"
733	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass."
734	1	2	2	"I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment."
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
737	1	1	1	"After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do."
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
739	1	1	0	"As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results."
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
741	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment."
742	1	0	0	"For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment."
743	1	0	0	"I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample."
744	1	3	3	"Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger."
745	1	2	3	"They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume."
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
747	1	3	3	"You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not."
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
750	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used."
751	1	2	1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
752	1	0	0	"Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem."
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
754	1	2	3	"The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?"
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
758	1	3	2	"In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended."
759	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated."
760	1	1	1	"The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used."
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
762	1	2	3	"I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary."
763	1	2	2	"Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions."
764	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list."
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	"Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers."
768	1	1	1	"In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found."
769	1	2	2	"You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment."
770	1	2	2	"The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have"
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
772	1	0	0	"The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this."
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
774	1	0	0	"The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment."
775	1	0	0	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass."
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
777	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing."
778	1	1	1	"After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment."
779	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use."
780	1	0	0	"Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete."
781	1	2	2	"There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment."
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
784	1	1	1	"They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected."
785	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately."
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
788	1	3	3	"How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas."
789	1	2	2	"Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded."
790	1	2	2	"Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used."
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
792	1	0	0	"After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well."
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
794	1	1	1	"After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass."
795	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it."
796	1	1	0	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
798	1	1	1	"Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container."
799	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known."

I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar."

809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.

830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
832	1	2	2	"The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks."
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.

865	1	2	2	"In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples."
866	1	2	2	"First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds."
867	1	1	1	"When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible."
868	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated."
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.

In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample."
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
899	1	0	0	"Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water."

902	1	1	1	"Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using."
903	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment."

Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?"

In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.

914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
915	1	1	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?"
916	1	0	0	"I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples."

918	1	1	1	"First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass."
919	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample."

921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	"Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period."
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
924	1	2	3	"To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in."
925	1	1	1	"In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use."
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
927	1	3	3	"In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure."
928	1	3	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state."
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
930	1	1	1	"After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure."
931	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did."
932	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results."
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
935	1	3	3	"We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours."
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
938	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours."
939	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container."
940	1	3	3	"After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup."
941	1	1	1	"Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween."
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
944	1	1	1	"After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with."
945	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects."
946	1	2	2	"In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate."
947	1	3	3	"Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure."
948	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow."
949	1	3	2	"In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results."
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
951	1	1	1	"I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry."
952	1	0	0	"Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample."
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	"You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial."
955	1	2	2	"After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable."
956	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be."
957	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?"
958	1	2	1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
959	1	3	3	"After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples."
960	1	0	0	"To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container."
961	1	2	2	"The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?"
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
966	1	1	1	"In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well."
967	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold."
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
970	1	3	2	"First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples."
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
972	1	2	2	"The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples."
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
974	1	0	0	"I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational."
975	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment."
976	1	1	0	"In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment"
977	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment."
978	1	0	2	"This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio."
979	1	2	2	"Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?)."
980	1	1	1	"The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings."
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
982	1	3	3	"The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?"
983	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow."
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."

986	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time."
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
989	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of."
990	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment."
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
993	1	1	1	"Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And"
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
995	1	3	3	"In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment."
996	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material."
997	1	3	1	"How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be."
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1000	1	0	1	"Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size."
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1002	1	2	2	"After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end."
1003	1	3	2	"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container."
1004	1	2	2	"One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves."
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	"The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need."
1009	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control."
1010	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need."
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.

1024	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be."
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1026	1	1	1	"The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used.

I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment."
1032	1	1	1	"The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure."
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.

Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data."

Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?"
1042	1	2	2	"The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on."
1043	1	3	3	"The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic."
1044	1	1	1	"The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers."
1045	1	2	2	"After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container."
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	"After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure."
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1050	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples."

How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?"
1056	1	3	3	"To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours."
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1059	1	1	1	"If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample."
1060	1	1	1	"You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?"
1061	1	2	2	"First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another."

As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment."
1066	1	1	2	"Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups.

1067	1	3	3	"After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used."
1068	1	3	3	"The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?"
1069	1	1	1	"You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar."
1070	1	0	0	"Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first."
1071	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment."
1072	1	2	2	"In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added."
1073	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results."
1074	1	0	0	"What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water."

1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."

1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1080	1	3	3	"The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp)."
1081	1	2	2	"After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers.

They don't have a control to show how the others were affected."
1083	1	3	3	"The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result."
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.

1096	1	3	3	"You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use."

1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."

Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group."
1104	1	1	0	"One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control."
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.

1114	1	2	2	"The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things."
1115	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment."

1282	1	2	2	"The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant."
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1284	1	2	2	"You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and."
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1288	1	0	0	"I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee.

Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment."
1302	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one."
1303	1	1	1	"You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly."
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1305	1	0	0	"You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment."

Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure."
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1320	1	1	1	"The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible."
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.

A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass."
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1376	1	1	1	"You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process."

1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1386	1	3	3	"In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently.

1394	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
1395	1	1	1	"What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with."
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1397	1	2	2	"You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out."
1398	1	0	0	"After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material."
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1400	1	1	1	"After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in."
1401	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours."
1402	1	0	0	"You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment."
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1406	1	3	3	"To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else."
1407	1	2	2	"The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material."
1408	1	0	0	"Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time."
1409	1	0	0	"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials."
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1411	1	3	2	"For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's."
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1415	1	3	3	"The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab."
1416	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used."
1417	1	1	1	"Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data."
1418	1	3	3	"Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry."
1419	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers."
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1421	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container."
1422	1	0	0	"First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container."
1423	1	2	2	"Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts."
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1425	1	3	3	"After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety."
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	"The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each."
1429	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results."
1430	1	1	1	"They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure."
1431	1	2	2	"To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear."
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1437	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area."
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1441	1	0	0	"To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph."
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1444	1	3	3	"To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment."
1445	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know."
1446	1	1	1	"More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart."
1447	1	0	0	"In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better."
1448	1	0	0	"The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment."
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1450	1	0	0	"To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at."
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1455	1	2	2	"They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container."
1456	1	2	2	"Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure."
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1458	1	3	3	"To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment."
1459	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours."
1460	1	2	2	"First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason."
1461	1	2	2	"The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment."
1462	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need."
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1468	1	2	2	"To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?"
1469	1	2	1	"In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should."
1470	1	3	3	"The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use."
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1472	1	2	2	"I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass."
1473	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples."
1474	1	3	3	"To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample."
1475	1	2	2	"To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens."
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1477	1	2	1	"After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment."
1478	1	0	0	"So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference."
1479	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass."
1480	1	3	3	"One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers."
1481	1	3	2	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1482	1	0	0	"In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with."
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1484	1	2	2	"You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab."
1485	1	2	2	"Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful."
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1488	1	0	1	"The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did."
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	"The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not."
1491	1	0	0	"After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels."
1492	1	3	3	"In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed."
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1494	1	0	0	"First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time."
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1496	1	2	2	"In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results."
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1498	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment."
1499	1	0	0	"The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)"
1500	1	3	3	"After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment."
1501	1	1	1	"In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples."
1502	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect."
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1504	1	1	1	"You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it."
1505	1	2	2	"The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment."
1506	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples."
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1508	1	2	2	"In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use"
1509	1	2	3	"There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table."
1510	1	2	2	"In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with.

1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.

1518	1	2	2	"The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid."

They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."

One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours."
1631	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container."
1632	1	3	2	"If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material."
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1635	1	2	2	"First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup."
1636	1	1	0	"Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations."
1637	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to."
1638	1	2	2	"The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples."
1639	1	1	1	"In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need."
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1641	1	2	2	"First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated"
1642	1	1	1	"I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled."
1643	1	2	2	"To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse."
1644	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is."
1645	1	1	1	"The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment."
1646	1	1	1	"In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer."
1647	1	3	3	"The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified."
1648	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion."
1649	1	2	2	"The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified."
1650	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment."
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1652	1	1	1	"I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out)."
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1654	1	2	2	"If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses."
1655	1	2	2	"To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors."
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1657	1	2	2	"I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)"
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1660	1	3	3	"You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours."
1661	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc)."
1662	1	2	2	"Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment."
1663	1	0	0	"I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate."
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1665	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties."
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1668	1	3	3	"The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar."
1669	1	0	0	"Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass."
1670	1	0	0	"To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample."
1671	1	1	1	"We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass."
1672	1	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment."
