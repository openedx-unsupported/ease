"A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation. Procedure: 1. Determine the mass of four different samples. 2. Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers. 3. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. 6. Determine the mass of each sample. The students’ data are recorded in the table below. Sample Starting Mass (g) Ending Mass (g) Difference in Mass (g) Marble 9.8 9.4 –0.4 Limestone 10.4 9.1 –1.3 Wood 11.2 11.2 0.0 Plastic 7.2 7.1 –0.1"
